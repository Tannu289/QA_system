50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit.,what temperature does it need to be to pour concrete,"Ideally, concrete should be poured when the air temperature is between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold temperatures slow the concrete-setting process, and when temperatures dip below freezing, the delay allows the water in the mix to freeze before the concrete hardens.Placing decorative concrete in cold weather is no different than any other concrete, but here are a few extra tips: Keep a dial pocket thermometer or an infrared thermometer to test the concrete temperature. Remember that you need to keep it above 50Â°F for the concrete to keep gaining strength."

All animal and plant cells.Mitochondria,what organelle generates energy for a cell,"What organelle captures energy the cell needs to carry out its functions? In plants and a few other organisms that can do photosynthesis, the organelle that uses the energy from sunlight to form chemical bonds (namely,glucose) and thus capture ene â€¦ rgy is the chloroplast. The energy in the bonds of these compounds (glucose) can later be released during the process of cellular respiration.All animal and plant cells contain organelles, little organs, which regulate specific functions within the cell. Two types of organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, are energy-related; they supply molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which power the processes of life and growth. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a high-energy molecule contained in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. This molecule provides all energy needed for various physiological processes, and is renewed through oxidation, so a cell always contains a supply of ATP to fuel the energy demands of the organism."
4 months.,what age can cats be spayed,"Cats can be spayed or neutered at 4 months. By this age, cats should have received their immunizations and been treated for common parasites, thus making them good candidates for elective procedures. Declawing can be done as early as 3 months of age. Shelters canâ€™t wait until kittens are six months old before neutering and spaying. They donâ€™t have the room, and it would deprive potential adopters of experiencing the joys of their kittenâ€™s kittenhood. Studies have shown that kittens can be spayed and neutered as early as 8 weeks of age, with no deleterious effect. Your cat, at 16 weeks of age, can be spayed with no worries at all.

"5-6 minutes,10 - 15 minutes or until the potato feels soft enought to eat.",how long to microwave a potato before baking it,"Place the uncooked sweet potatoes in a dish that is both oven and microwave safe, such as a ceramic or glass baking dish. Microwave your potatoes for four minutes and then transfer them to a 450-degree oven and cook for an additional four to five minutes. This makes it easier to peel the sweet potato after baking. You can wrap the oiled potato in foil before placing in the oven so the potato cooks evenly and the moisture and oils stay with the potato. Or, place the oiled potatoes on a cookie sheet or in a pan and bake them at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 to 50 minutes.1 For example, if one large potato takes 10 minutes to cook, two large potatoes would take between 16-17 minutes. 2  If you prefer crispy skinned potatoes, you can cook the potatoes in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 400 Â°F (204 Â°C) for 20 minutes. 6.

It is a cordlike structure that contains many axons.It look like a cobweb or like a tree's roots.,what does a nerve look like,"Each nerve is a cordlike structure that contains many axons. Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the endoneurium. The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium. In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts. Neurons are sometimes called nerve cells, though this term is potentially misleading since many neurons do not form nerves, and nerves also include non-neuronal Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin.Symptoms of Sciatica. The most common symptom of sciatica is lower back pain that extends through the hip and buttock and down one leg. The pain usually affects only one leg and may get worse when you sit, cough, or sneeze. The leg may also feel numb, weak, or tingly at times. But this doesn't always involve the sciatic nerve. In many cases, back pain is the result of overextending or straining the muscles in the lower back. What most often sets sciatica apart is the way the pain radiates down the leg and into the foot. It may feel like a bad leg cramp that lasts for day"

"Three types of muscles. The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiacSkeletal muscles â€” These muscles contract to pull on tendons and move the bones of the skeleton. 2 In addition to producing skeletal movement, muscles also maintain posture and body position, support soft tissues, guard entrances and exits to the digestive and urinary tracts, and maintain body temperature. Skeletal muscles â€” These muscles contract to pull on tendons and move the bones of the skeleton. 2 In addition to producing skeletal movement, muscles also maintain posture and body position, support soft tissues, guard entrances and exits to the digestive and urinary tracts, and maintain body temperature.",briefly explain how muscles produce movement,"Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism. The arms and legs are part of the appendicular skeleton. The upper bones of the limbs are single: humerus (arm) and femur (leg). Below a joint (elbow or knee), both limbs have a pair of bones (radius and ulna in the arms; tibia and fibula in legs) that connect to another joint (wrist or ankle).(Also Called 'Normal Structure and Function of the Musculoskeletal System-Anatomy'). A basic primer on bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and cartilages.

"The human body is composed of just four basic kinds of tissue: nervous, muscular, epithelial, and connective tissue. Connective tissue is the most abundant, widely distributed, and varied type.",connective tissue definition biology,"Photo by: Alila. The human body is composed of just four basic kinds of tissue: nervous, muscular, epithelial, and connective tissue. Connective tissue is the most abundant, widely distributed, and varied type. It includes fibrous tissues, fat, cartilage, bone, bone marrow, and blood. The most abundant fiber in connective tissues is a tough protein called collagen. Tendons, ligaments, and the white stringy tissue (fascia) seen in some cuts of meat are composed almost entirely of collagen, as is leather, which consists of the connective tissue layer (dermis) of animal skins.In biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level intermediate between cells and a complete organ. A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood has plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid.Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues."
80 to 260 days,how long to grow a sugar maple tree,"1 The sugar maple can grow to a height of 100 feet and have a spread of 70 to 80 feet. 2  For planting in smaller sites, look for the Goldspire variety. 3  It features a narrower canopy and has golden autumn leaves. 4  The dense canopy of the sugar maple is excellent for providing shade and keeping houses cool. Tips & Warnings. 1  The sugar maple is a deciduous broadleaf tree that is successfully grown in zones 3 through 8. 2  Check the USDA Hardiness Zone map to verify its suitability in your area. 3  The sugar maple can grow to a height of 100 feet and have a spread of 70 to 80 feet.Sugar maple trees average about 1 foot of height growth and 0.2 inch of diameter growth annually for the first 30 to 40 years. Hence a 30-year-old tree might be 6 to 8 inches in diameter and 30 to 35 feet in height. After about 140 to 150 years, height growth ceases and radial growth slows greatly. Thus average growing seasons are from 80 to 260 days. Soils Sugar maple can survive in a wide variety of soil types, but for maximum tree growth and sap production, soils should be deep, moist, and well drained with medium or fine textures."

Blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart.,what are veins,"Veins are blood vessels which carry deoxygenated (or very low levels of oxygen) blood back to the heart. The exception to this rule is the pulmonary vein, which carries oxygenated blood, from the lungs, back to the heart, ready to be pumped around the rest of the body. In the circulatory system, veins (from the Latin vena) are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart. Veins are less muscular than arteries and are often closer to the skin. There are valves in most veins to prevent backflow. The arteries are perceived as carrying oxygenated blood to the tissues, while veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This is true of the systemic circulation, by far the larger of the two circuits of blood in the body, which transports oxygen from the heart to the tissues of the body."

The composition of tissue fluid depends upon the exchanges between the cells in the biological tissue and the blood. This means that tissue fluid has a different composition in different tissues and in different areas of the body. This causes a slight difference in the concentration of cations and anions between the two fluid compartments.,differences between blood and tissue fluid composition,"Interstitial fluid consists of a water solvent containing sugars, salts, fatty acids, amino acids, coenzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, as well as waste products from the cells. The composition of tissue fluid depends upon the exchanges between the cells in the biological tissue and the blood. This means that tissue fluid has a different composition in different tissues and in different areas of the body. The ionic composition of the interstitial fluid and blood plasma vary due to the Gibbsâ€“Donnan effect. This causes a slight difference in the concentration of cations and anions between the two fluid compartments.- To prevent a build-up of tissue fluid surrounding the cells in the tissue, the lymphatic system plays a part in the transport of tissue fluid. - Tissue fluid can pass into the surrounding lymph vessels (now called Lymph), and eventually ends up rejoining the blood. Julia Syozitaro. Confidence votes 23. The primary differences between plasma and interstitial fluid involve (1) the concentrations of dissolved proteins, because plasma proteins cannot cross capillary walls, and (2) the levels of respiratory gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), due to the respiratory activities of tissue cells."

"Adenine(A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond.",which nitrogenous base is found exclusively in dna,"These nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the twisted ladder or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides. Adenine is always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. These are known as base pairs.A DNA nucleotide is composed of 3 main units: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. While the sugar and phosphate group alternate in sequence and form the backbone of the DNA double helix, the nitrogenous bases may differ in every adjoining nucleotide. The four nitrogenous bases present in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). In RNA, the only differing nitrogenous base is uracil (U) (which replaces thymine in DNA and differs thymine only by the missing methyl group at carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring)"

Endothelium,the epithelium that lines the inside of a blood vessel is called,"Answer: a. The lining of a blood vessel is simple squamous epithelium. This lining is called endothelium. Epithelium lines body cavities and surfaces. Simple squamous epithelium is simple because it is one cell thick. Squamous refers to the fact that the cells are flat. 3. Epithelium lines body cavities and surfaces. Pseudostratified squamous epithelium is pseudostratified because it is only one cell layer thick, yet it appears to be stratified. In reality, every cell touches the basement membrane.c. Endothelium --ANSWER. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels, forming an interface between circulating blood in the lumen and the rest of the vessel wall. Endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system, from the heart to the smallest capillary. Endothelium is simple squamous epithelium that lines the vascular system. Transitional epithelium is seen in the urinary tract. Transitional epithelium has dome shaped cells on the apical surface. Pseudostratified epithelium is a type of epithelium that has cells which all touch the basement membrane."

Untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia cause about 90% of all cases of PID. Other causes include abortion, childbirth, and pelvic procedures. It is rare, but you can get PID without having an STD. No one is sure why, but normal bacteria found in the vagina and on the cervix can sometimes cause PID."
It produces primary transcript RNA.,what is the function of rna polymerase?,"Compare RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase (RNAP or RNApol) (Ribonucleic acid), also known as DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is an enzyme that produces primary transcript RNA. In cells, RNAP is necessary for constructing RNA chains using DNA genes as templates, a process called transcription. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential to life and are found in all organisms and many viruses. In chemical terms, RNAP is a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript.Prior to addition of DNA nucleotides by DNA Polymerase, an RNA primer must first be added by primase. This is because DNA polymerase is not capable of getting the party started on its own. The RNA primer is eventually removed to allow for a long continuous DNA strand."
